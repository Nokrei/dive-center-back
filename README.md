The final team project for my full-stack coding bootcamp. It is a diving center website, connected to multiple databases - courses, users, blog posts. For the front-end it uses ReactJS, some bootstrap, material UI, and plain CSS. Back-end is done via NodeJS(Express). It uses Mongoose to connect to the MongoDB database. Users can register, log in and update their profiles. We had little time to complete the project - hence many features are missing and the styling is not complete. Some features like the blog and ability to add new posts (by admin user) have been added by me after the project had been handed in. I have plans to further update the app.
Note the site takes a while to initially load as Heroku(hosting) 'puts it to sleep' when not being frequently accessed.
